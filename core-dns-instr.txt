1. Download CoreDNS

Visit the official CoreDNS releases page on GitHub: https://github.com/coredns/coredns/releases
Identify the latest release (or choose a specific version) and download the archive appropriate for your server's architecture (likely linux_amd64.tgz).
Example:
<!-- end list -->

Bash

wget https://github.com/coredns/coredns/releases/download/v1.10.1/coredns_1.10.1_linux_amd64.tgz
2. Extract and Install

Extract the downloaded archive:
<!-- end list -->

Bash

tar xvf coredns_1.10.1_linux_amd64.tgz
Move the coredns binary to your desired installation location (e.g., /usr/local/bin):
<!-- end list -->

Bash

sudo mv coredns /usr/local/bin/
3. Create a CoreDNS User

For security best practices, create a dedicated user for CoreDNS:
<!-- end list -->

Bash

sudo useradd -d /var/lib/coredns -m coredns
4. Configure CoreDNS

Create the CoreDNS configuration directory:
<!-- end list -->

Bash

sudo mkdir /etc/coredns
Create the main configuration file (Corefile) within that directory:
<!-- end list -->

Bash

sudo nano /etc/coredns/Corefile
Populate the Corefile with your desired configuration. Here's a basic example using Cloudflare's DNS servers:
<!-- end list -->

. {
    forward . 1.1.1.1 1.0.0.1
    log
}
5. Install resolvconf

Install resolvconf to manage DNS resolution:
<!-- end list -->

Bash

sudo apt install resolvconf
6. Configure resolvconf

Add a file to include your CoreDNS server as a nameserver:
<!-- end list -->

Bash

sudo nano /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head
Add the following line to the file:
<!-- end list -->

nameserver 127.0.0.1
7. Create a Systemd Service File

Create a service file to manage CoreDNS with systemd:
<!-- end list -->

Bash

sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/coredns.service
Add the following content to the file:
<!-- end list -->

[Unit]
Description=CoreDNS DNS Server
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=coredns
Group=coredns
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/coredns -conf /etc/coredns/Corefile

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
8. (Optional) Disable systemd-resolved

If you want CoreDNS to handle all DNS resolution, you might need to disable systemd-resolved:
<!-- end list -->

Bash

sudo systemctl stop systemd-resolved
sudo systemctl disable systemd-resolved
9. Start and Enable CoreDNS

Reload systemd to recognize the new service:
<!-- end list -->

Bash

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
Start the CoreDNS service:
<!-- end list -->

Bash

sudo systemctl start coredns
Enable CoreDNS to start automatically on boot:
<!-- end list -->

Bash

sudo systemctl enable coredns
10. Verify Installation

Check the status of the CoreDNS service:
<!-- end list -->

Bash

sudo systemctl status coredns
Use dig to test DNS resolution:
<!-- end list -->

Bash

dig google.com @127.0.0.1
Installing CoreDNS Plugins

CoreDNS has a modular design with various plugins to extend its functionality. Here's how to install and use them:

Choose a Plugin: Refer to the official CoreDNS documentation ([invalid URL removed]) to find plugins that suit your needs.

Enable in Corefile: Add the plugin's name to your Corefile, along with any required configuration options. For example, to enable the cache plugin:

<!-- end list -->

. {
    forward . 1.1.1.1 1.0.0.1
    cache
    log
}
Restart CoreDNS: After modifying the Corefile, restart the CoreDNS service for the changes to take effect:
<!-- end list -->

Bash

sudo systemctl restart coredns
Example Plugins

cache: Caches DNS responses to improve performance.
rewrite: Rewrites DNS queries based on defined rules.
hosts: Resolves hostnames from a local /etc/hosts file.
autopath: Automatically searches for the closest zone to respond to a query.
kubernetes: Provides DNS resolution for Kubernetes clusters.
metrics: Exports CoreDNS metrics for monitoring.
Remember to consult the CoreDNS documentation for specific instructions and configuration options for each plugin.





How to give port 53 bind permission for coredns user ?


You have a few options to give the coredns user permission to bind to port 53, which is a privileged port (ports below 1024):

1. setcap (Recommended)

This is the most secure method, as it grants only the necessary capability to the coredns binary.

Bash

sudo setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' /usr/local/bin/coredns
2. authbind

authbind allows non-root users to bind to privileged ports.

Install authbind:

Bash

sudo apt install authbind
Configure authbind to allow coredns to bind to port 53:

Bash

sudo touch /etc/authbind/byport/53
sudo chown coredns:coredns /etc/authbind/byport/53
sudo chmod 750 /etc/authbind/byport/53
Modify the coredns.service file to use authbind:

Bash

sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/coredns.service
Change ExecStart to:

ExecStart=/usr/sbin/authbind /usr/local/bin/coredns -conf /etc/coredns/Corefile
Reload systemd and restart CoreDNS:

Bash

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart coredns
3. Kernel Parameter (net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start)

This method allows any user to bind to ports below 1024, which is less secure.

Edit /etc/sysctl.conf:

Bash

sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf
Add the following line:

net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start=53
Apply the changes:

Bash

sudo sysctl -p
Important Notes:

Security: Using setcap is generally the most secure approach. Avoid changing the kernel parameter unless absolutely necessary.
Firewall: Ensure your firewall allows traffic on port 53 (UDP and TCP).
SELinux/AppArmor: If you have SELinux or AppArmor enabled, you may need to adjust their configurations to allow coredns to bind to port 53.
Remember to choose the method that best suits your security requirements. If you're unsure, setcap is generally the recommended option.






How to setup Zone file for a Internal Zone in CoreDNS


1. Create the Zone File

Choose a location for your zone files. A common location is /etc/coredns/zones.
Create a new file for your internal zone. For example, if your internal domain is example.local, you might create a file named /etc/coredns/zones/example.local.db.
Populate the zone file with DNS records in the standard zone file format. Here's an example:
$TTL 1D
@       IN SOA  ns1.example.local. hostmaster.example.local. (
                                2025012001 ; Serial
                                3H         ; Refresh
                                15M        ; Retry
                                1W         ; Expire
                                1D )       ; Negative Cache TTL
;
@               IN      NS      ns1.example.local.
ns1             IN      A       192.168.1.10
www             IN      A       192.168.1.20
server1         IN      A       192.168.1.50
This example defines:

$TTL 1D: Default Time-to-Live for records (1 day).
SOA record: Start of Authority record with administrative information about the zone.
NS record: Specifies the nameserver for the zone (ns1.example.local).
A records: Map hostnames to IP addresses.
2. Configure CoreDNS

Edit your Corefile (/etc/coredns/Corefile) to include the file plugin and specify the zone file:
example.local:53 {
    file /etc/coredns/zones/example.local.db
    log
}

. {
    forward . 1.1.1.1 1.0.0.1
    log
}
This configuration tells CoreDNS to:

Use the file plugin for the example.local zone, loading records from /etc/coredns/zones/example.local.db.
Forward all other queries to Cloudflare's DNS servers.
3. Restart CoreDNS

Reload systemd and restart CoreDNS to apply the changes:
Bash

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart coredns
4. Test DNS Resolution

Use dig to test if your internal zone is working correctly:
Bash

dig @127.0.0.1 www.example.local
This should return the IP address you defined for www.example.local in your zone file.

Important Considerations:

Zone File Syntax: Ensure your zone file adheres to the correct syntax. Errors in the zone file can prevent CoreDNS from loading the zone.
Access Control: If needed, you can use the allow and deny directives within the file plugin block to restrict access to your internal zone.
Reverse Zones: If you need reverse DNS lookups for your internal network, you'll need to create a reverse zone file and configure CoreDNS accordingly.
Dynamic Updates: If you need dynamic DNS updates for your internal zone, consider using the etcd plugin or integrating with a dynamic DNS service.
By following these steps, you can effectively set up zone files for your internal zones in CoreDNS, providing name resolution for your internal network.
